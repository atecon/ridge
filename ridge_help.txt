*** CV-DATA-GENERATOR ***

Package for generating datasets for cross-validation purposes.

Learning parameters of a prediction function is a major objective. In order to avoid
over-fitting, the model is trained on a different data sample (the 'training set')
and evaluated out-of-sample on a so called 'test set'. This approach is known as
cross-validation (CV).

This package comprises different approaches of dividing the raw data set into
a training and test set, respectively, depending on the nature of the underlying data.

An nice overview can be accessed here:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html

The separated data sets are stored in array of matrices, which can be read-in for the
original model training and evaluation.

Public Function:
================
CvDataGenerator()

Parameters:
============
b		-- bundle, at least including:
			(a) a list named 'X', or
			(b) a matrix named 'X' and column vector named 'index'
			refering to observations (genr index)

cv_type		-- string (optional), Type of cross-validation (CV): 'kfold'
			(default), 'loo' (Leave-One-Out)
n_folds  	-- int, divide sample into n_folds of groups of equal size ('kfold' default 5)


Returns:
========
X_train 	-- array of 'n_folds' matrices, each matrix is of dimension T by (1+k) holding
		the observation index in the 1st column and the training data for k variables
		across columns.
X_test 		-- array of 'n_folds' matrices, each matrix is of dimension T by (1+k)
		holding the observation index in the 1st column and the test data for k
		variables across columns.
